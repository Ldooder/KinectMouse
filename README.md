KinectMouse
===========

Just a basic lightweight KinectMouse. Clicking not implemented.

It is important to note that clicking is a feature disabled on purpose, as we want to currently avoid it. This project is being placed in the middle of Bytes, so the users will be unfamiliar with the gestures we decide upon as clicking. The UI and games will handle clicking by a hover over system for now, unless Great Leader Ben decides the KinectMouse Console Application should handle it instead. 

That is all.
